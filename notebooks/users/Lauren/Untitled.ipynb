    "# Making the most out of OSS\n",
    "\n",
    "Good kmorning everyone,\n",
    "\n",
    "so i want to talk to you a bit about community - this community...and how we can all get the most out of this summit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to start with telling you about how I, as someone who has been in the appsec world for a matter of months, have been able to contribute to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Funnily enough, only a few months before I decided to create the OWASP WIA chapter, I was overwhelmingly anti-women in security groups.\n",
    "Although there is an interesting story there, I won't talk about that right now but please come and talk to me if you want to know!\n",
    "\n",
    "What I do want to talk about though is why I felt it was appropriate to lead a chapter even though I'm still pretty new to the appsec community and have only been in this industry for 3 years!\n",
    "\n",
    "I figured out a way to contribute to the community/industry in a way that I can.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm completely in awe of so many of you here and I'm delighted to be a particpant. I genuinely can't wait for the year that I\n",
    "will be able to run a session or even a track and my real aspiration is to present something interesting on a technical subject which although I already had some idea in my head of what I reckon would be interesting to the appsec community - my new found obsession with Wardley Maps might be something I'll talk about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway the message I really want to get across is how to make the most of this summit.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are experts in the room but there are also newbies and I absolutely believe its been made pretty clear that everyone, no matter your experience, is welcome to contribute in whatever way they can whether that be this week or next week or next month - some of us need the brainspace and the time to really digest the things that we've learned this week in order to solutionise. That person's solution might appear in a few weeks time - great! Get on Slack - the OSS Slack AND the OWASP Slack and share your ideas!\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though, very unfortunately, this summit is only a week it by no way means our collobaration and outcomes are confined to this week - no way! We're all just touching base right now - meeting each other, learning about new things and getting updates but the virtual OSS needs to continue for us to make real impact on Application Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I have three calls to action.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is for all of us to keep on collaborating, keep on contributing - it's up to us to keep the momentum of this week going. There are so many ways to do this - don't feel like just because you haven't been able to say something in a session, your not of value. We all think differently, some of us can think on our feet in the moment and have the confidence to voice it,, some of us need time and prefer to share ideas with the session facilitator after the session by talking to them one to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "That brings me to the next two calls to action for sessions leaders - our facilitators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Really emphasize and welcome all the different ways people can contribute during and after each session whether that might be in person, a private message, through the Slack channel or through github. Really try and create an inclusive session so that each and every participant is empowered to contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an inclusive environment during your sessions by thinking about how to manage the more dominant participants in the room in order to make space to hear the voice of the quieter, perhaps more introvert, participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who am i to give this advice? Well I used to be a Maths teacher at a pretty tough inner-city school where the most important objective was to make progress. So if we really digest those three calls to action, I reckon thats how we make progress from this week.\n",
